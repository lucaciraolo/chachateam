                        <p class="lead">The ChaCha (Channel Challenge) Team is a group of 8 students, 6 of whom are going to relay swim across the English Channel in August 2016. We will begin our crossing in Dover and finish in Calais. This covers a distance of approximately 35km in a straight line (~50km taking into account currents). Our aim is to raise money for Obstetric Fistula.</p>
