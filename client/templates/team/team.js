        text: "My name is Ludmilla le Marié, I was born in France and I am 17 years old. I first started swimming when I was only just a baby, and I always loved the sea more than I liked pools. Therefore, when my friend Theodosia Catsiapis came to me with the insane idea of crossing the English Channel, I immediately said YES, with no second thought. I don't think that at the time I realised how big of a challenge I was getting myself into, but as the time passes I am more and more confident about us crossing it. I believe that we have now found and strong and determined team of girls that will reach France no matter what the circumstances."

        text: "If one word could describe me it would be adventurous. Whether it is hiking for 8 days, canoeing down a river, traveling to a foreign country or swimming the channel, I throw myself head and shoulders into every adventure no matter how big or small. For the last few years I have been looking for the ultimate challenge that tested me both mentally and physically whilst at the same time reaching out to the global community. As a dedicated competitive swimmer for the last 8 years, who trains 5-6 times a week, by finding something that uses the skills I have built up, allows me to help other whilst pursuing a passion. When swimming the channel as a relay to raise money of obstetric fistula came up, the seed was planted towards this ultimate challenge. And so the adventure begins..."

        text: "My name is Theodosia Catsiapis and I am 16 years old. Last year I read an article about a man named Phillipe Croizon who lost both his arms and his legs and still managed to swim across the English Channel. His inspiring story made me think, well if he can do it, so can I. A Channel relay swim is challenge that tests endurance, determination and essentially team work. I know that this will probably the hardest thing I have ever done, but I am motivated and ready to commit especially since I am doing it for a cause that is so close to my heart. I have been strongly engaged in raising money for Obstetric Fistula since April 2015, after having visited Ethiopia. When I realised that this challenge could raise money for these poor, suffering girls I looked further into it, gathered a team, started training and now here we are- the first under 18 Swiss Channel relay team in history!"

        text: "My name is Josephine Brenoe. I am from Denmark and The Netherlands however August 2015 marks the beginning of my time living in Europe. Before living here, I was living in India for 4 years and earlier than that I was living in the Philippines. I have always loved to participate in sports and I love being a member of a team. The sports that I focus on primarily are football and swimming. Since I moved to Switzerland I have taken my sports activity to a whole new level. I have always been constantly motivated to push myself and improve in the sports that I love. This is especially true for swimming. Swimming is a sport that pushes me beyond my abilities both mentally and physically. Therefore, when I was told about this Swiss Channel Challenge I was ready to dig my teeth into this incredible new activity. There was and has been no shortage of nervousness, pride, excitement and teamwork during the preparation for this challenge. From here, I can only hope that I continue experiencing this whole process to the fullest. I know that I must work my hardest to insure that I succeed. For that, I am 110% ready to dive right in."

I used to live in London and competed for several years but when I moved to Geneva I wanted to row and run track for my school team rather than compete in swimming. Nevertheless I still loved to swim in my own and missed it for a while. Then one day, my sports science teacher spoke to me after class and informed that there is a group of girls that are going to do something crazy, a great group of swimmers who wanted to cross the channel. I accepted before my teacher managed to finish his sentence! I saw this as an opportunity to do something incredible that not everyone can say they have done and help eradicate something that should no longer exist in today's society."
